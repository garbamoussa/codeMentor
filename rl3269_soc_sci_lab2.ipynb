    "In order to complete the second part of your homework you will need to determine the fraction of similar neighbors of any given given cell. So given 2-D array like the one you made above, write a function that determines the fraction of neighbors in the same demographic as the cell i,j.  That is, write a function that takes three parameters: a 2-D array arr, a row location i, a column location j and returns a float representing the fraction of neighbors around arr[i,j] that are the in the same population.  This is one is long and a little bit tougher than the one above. Give it a shot but don't worry if you don't have it finished by Saturday night. "
